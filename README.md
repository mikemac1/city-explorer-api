- What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

The steps to build the express server. Definitely a few of them but it felt good to get it running with no issues. Of course nothing was going on with regards to requests or responses between the front & back end but the initial server build felt good.

- What did I learn today?

The importance of understanding the data object you are reaching out to. After getting stuck and watching three T/As struggle with connecting to it as well it is definitely not an easy subject to master.

- What should I do differently next time?

Really I am not sure. I asked for help quickly and I'm worse off now than I was yesterday.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

I literally do not get the syntax, or the components required for the passing of data between the front-end and back-end. A big part of that is the data itself but putting it together is even more complex and I'm trying to work thru it.
