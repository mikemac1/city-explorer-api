(ver. 1.0)

## Author - Mike McCarty

This project is the third JS React app Using the first Back-End Server

## Lab 07/08

## Problem Domain

15/16 November - This server was originally built to be the API for receiving requests from the city-explorer front-end server to gain the weather data for three cities. Currently sending weather data but not yet being displayed on the front-end as it still needs to be built.
17 November - Weather data is now functioning in a modal for each city on the front end with appropriate error handling.
19 November - Shifted weather data to be retrieved from Weather Bit versus using the weather.json file.
20 November - Able to retrieve data from The Movie DB API and format it to send to the front end.
